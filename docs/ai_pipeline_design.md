# AI Pipeline Design for Viztron Homebase Module

## Overview

This document provides a detailed design of the AI pipeline for the Viztron Homebase Module. The AI pipeline is a critical component of the system, responsible for processing video streams from multiple cameras, detecting objects, tracking their movements, recognizing faces, analyzing behavior, and assessing potential security threats.

The pipeline is designed to leverage the BeagleBoard Y-AI's hardware capabilities, particularly its NPU with 4 TOPS of AI processing power, to efficiently process up to 16 camera streams simultaneously. The design focuses on modularity, efficiency, resource optimization, and accuracy.

## Pipeline Architecture

The AI pipeline follows a modular architecture with six main stages, each responsible for a specific aspect of video analysis:

1. **Input Processing**: Handles video stream acquisition and preprocessing
2. **Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies objects in the video frames
3. **Object Tracking**: Tracks objects across frames using ByteTrack
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features including face recognition with ArcFace
5. **Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes object movements and behaviors using LSTM models
6. **Threat Assessment**: Evaluates potential security threats based on rules and ML models

### Pipeline Data Flow

The data flows through the pipeline as follows:

1. Raw video frames from cameras → Input Processing
2. Preprocessed frames → Object Detection
3. Detection results → Object Tracking
4. Tracking results → Feature Extraction
5. Extracted features → Behavior Analysis
6. Behavior analysis results → Threat Assessment
7. Threat assessment results → Alert Generation and User Interface

Each stage processes the data and passes the results to the next stage, with the option to store intermediate results for debugging and analysis.
